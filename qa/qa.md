- Prepare Tests:
    - Create a suite of tests (automated or manual) that validate the edge cases and failure scenarios, especially the
      validation rules.
    - Test invalid rating, missing fields, and improper comment formats.
- Focus on Overlooked Areas:
    - Test empty, null, or non-alphanumeric values for productId and userId.
    - Ensure the response includes appropriate error messages.
- Edge Cases:
    - Developers often forget to validate comment length when it's provided.
    - Ensure productId and userId are alphanumeric; developers might skip this.
- Non-Happy Path:
    - Emphasize returning proper error responses for invalid input.
    - Developers may skip or inconsistently handle HTTP 400 responses.
